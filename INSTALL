IRIS installation
==================

This is the quickstart documentation for trying out IRIS and installing the tool.

The development environment has been tested to work with virtualenv.

To build the project:

    $ python setup.py build

To install development dependencies for the project (requires pip):

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

Note that python-ldap requires the following packages on Debian/Ubuntu:

    python-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev libssl-dev

And on OpenSUSE and RedHat:

    python-devel openldap-devel cyrus-sasl-devel

The package may also be found in your distribution's package repositories.

To install the project locally:

    $ python setup.py install

To access the Django management shell:

    $ python $(python -c "from iris import manage; print(manage.__file__)" shell

If you wish to try how the development server looks, you can do:

    $ MNG_SCRIPT=$(python -c "from iris import manage; print(manage.__file__)"
    $ python $MNG_SCRIPT syncdb
    $ python $MNG_SCRIPT migrate
    $ python $MNG_SCRIPT runserver

After this you should get an usable URL and be able to access the service.

Please refer to DEPLOY in docs folder for more detailed instructions.
