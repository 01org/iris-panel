    npm python python-virtualenv python-pip python-devel openldap-devel cyrus-sasl-devel libldapcpp-devel


Automatic installation steps
----------------------------

After installing the distribution packages, you can generate a development environment with

    $ make devel


Credentials
-----------

After installing the service you can log in with each of the following credentials to test it out:

NormalUser:password
StaffUser:password
AdminUser:password


Manual installation steps
-------------------------

To install development dependencies for the project (requires pip):

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

To build the after installing dependancies project:

    $ python setup.py build

To install the project locally:

    $ python setup.py install

To access the Django management shell:

    $ python $(python -c "from iris import manage; print(manage.__file__)" shell

If you wish to try how the development server looks, you can do:

    $ MNG_SCRIPT=$(python -c "from iris import manage; print(manage.__file__)"
    $ python $MNG_SCRIPT syncdb
    $ python $MNG_SCRIPT migrate
    $ python $MNG_SCRIPT runserver

After this you should get an usable URL and be able to access the service.

Frontend libraries can be installed manually as well; please consult
the bin/generate_environment.sh script for installing with bower.

Please refer to DEPLOY in docs folder for more detailed instructions.
